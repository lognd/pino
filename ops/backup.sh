# remote, no rclone.conf needed -- see BACKUP_R2_* below). A single-VPS
# deployment with only on-box backups is a single point of failure (the
# VPS itself dying takes the backups with it) -- see
# docs/design/11-deployment.md. Waivers are legal documents (see
# docs/design/06-waivers-and-legal.md) -- this backup is not optional
# polish, it must be tested once before the first real class is booked

# the unrecognized scheme, so this would fail on every real run without
